#~ The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#~ 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

#~ The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#~ (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

#~ Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#~ first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.
#~ Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
#~ one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
